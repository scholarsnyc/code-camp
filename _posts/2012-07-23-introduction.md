## Why Learn to Program?

So, you signed up for this endeavor (good choice, by the way), but your probably thinking: "Why should I bother learning to program?" Maybe you want to be a programmer. If so, well then learning to program is a pretty good idea, but maybe you don't want to program professionally. Learning to program is still an important skill. Computers aren't going away anytime soon. Learning how to use them and bend them to your whim can make you _way_ better at anything you put your mind to.

More importantly, you can [build a robot that shoots a water gun at the squirrels that try to raid your bird feeder][squirrels] or [hack a Microsoft Kinect][kinect].

For the purposes of the next few weeks, we're going to focus on three major objectives. There are many, many more reasons to learn this stuff—but these are the three things we're going to keep rounding back to over the course of this week. Call them themes, if you want. Call them big ideas, just don't call them Sally—they really don't like that.

* Learning to code gives you the ability to take your ideas and make them a reality.
* The web is malleable. With JavaScript (and other languages), you can alter and change anything you want.
* The web is full of powerful APIs that allow you to make interesting things by mashing two or more existing things together.

## What We're Going to Cover

The next three weeks are going to be jam-packed. Because I like bulleted lists so much, I've made yet another one to illustrate the main points we are going to cover over the next three weeks. Ironically, this list has four bullet points.

* Taking control of the web with JavaScript
* Building a custom Google Chrome extension
* Create interactive graphics with Processing and Processing.js
* Building an HTML5 application for iOS, Android, and Chrome OS

### The Structure of this Hoopla

If you can believe it, the plan is that I am going to try to keep the talking to a minimum (Yea, I know). I'll show you just enough to make you dangerous and then let you hack away. The best way to learn this stuff is just to do it—even if you have to make heavy use of Google to get it done.
