I don't work in Windows too often, so I'm not up on all of the latest text editors. These are some good ones that I've heard people say nice things about. If you come across any other ones that I should add to this list, let me know.

* [Notepad++][npp]
* [gedit][gedit]
* [Sublime Text][subl]

Sublime Text is available on Mac OS X and it's pretty good. Many professionals use it. It's not free, but as far as I know, the trial never runs out.

On Mac OS X, I use [BBEdit][], but you can use it's free version, [TextWrangler][tw].
