JavaScript is getting a lot of interest lately. As a result, there are a plethora of excellent resources available for free on the Internet.

* [_Eloquent JavaScript: A Modern Introduction to Programming_][eloquent] by Marijn Haverbeke is an excellent book for beginners looking to wrap their heads around the basics of JavaScript. Marijn goes into a lot more depth than I do. But what makes this book really cool is the fact that you can practice coding inside the book as you read along.
* [Codecademy][Codecademy] lets you learn through practicing. The site had an interactive JavaScript console. Codecademy provides you with exercises and guidance about some of the finer points of JavaScript. In my opinion, Codecademy is a little dry if it's the only thing you're doing to learn to code. But it's great to practice your skills in between hacking sessions on your next great invention.
* [appendTo][apto] is a collection of free screencasts that introduce the foundations of programming in JavaScript. The series starts with the basics of JavaScript and progresses to web page manipulation and jQuery.
* [jQuery Air: First Flight][jqair] is a mix of video tutorial and interactive exercises (like those on Codecademy). Jeff Casimir is a teacher by trade, so he's pretty good at explaining stuff. The course covers [jQuery][], which is a library that extends JavaScript and gives it magical powers.
* [_jQuery Fundamentals_][jqfun] is another free online book. This one coveres jQuery, which I discussed above. As you can tell by looking at the table of contents, it's long. You might want to approach it in doses. Read a little, try it out, and come back fro me when you feel like you've mastered that skill.
