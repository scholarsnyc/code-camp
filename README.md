# The Scholars' Academy Code Camp #

This summer, we're running launching a new program to teach enthusiastic students how to code. For the lack of a better name, it's currently called _Code Camp_ (mostly because I enjoy alliteration). That said, I'm not entirely pleased with the name, but I had to name it something, right?

## Goals ##

Basically, there are a few key things that I want students to get out of this program:

* Learning to code gives you the ability to take your ideas and make them a reality.
* The web is malleable. With JavaScript (and other languages), you can alter and change anything you want.
* The web is full of powerful APIs that allow you to make interesting things by mashing two or more existing things together.

## General Outline ##

(What follows is definitely a work-in-progress and will mostly likely change frequently.)
