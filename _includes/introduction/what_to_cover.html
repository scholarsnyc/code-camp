<h2>What We're Going to Cover</h2>

<p>The next three weeks are going to be jam-packed. Because I like bulleted lists so much, I&#8217;ve made yet another one to illustrate the main points we are going to cover over the next three weeks. Ironically, this list has four bullet points.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Taking control of the web with JavaScript</li>
	<li>Building a custom Google Chrome extension</li>
	<li>Create interactive graphics with Processing and Processing.js</li>
	<li>Building an HTML5 application for iOS, Android, and Chrome OS</li>
</ul>

<p>If you can believe it, the plan is that I am going to try to keep the talking to a minimum (Yea, I know). I&#8217;ll show you just enough to make you dangerous and then let you hack away. The best way to learn this stuff is just to do itâ€”even if you have to make heavy use of Google to get it done.</p>
