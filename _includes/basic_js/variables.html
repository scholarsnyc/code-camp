<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>

<p>Typing stuff over and over again is tedious and a quick recipe for crazy-making. It&#8217;s also a formula for really bad programming. Why? Because we&#8217;re human—I am, at least—and humans tend to make mistakes. If I asked you to type the same thing 10,000 times, chances are that you would make a mistake <em>at least</em> once. The way we handle that in JavaScript is we store our important data in <strong>variables</strong>.</p>

<p>Using variables is pretty easy. It&#8217;s a two-step process. First we declare the variable, then we define it. Let&#8217;s say that I wanted to create a variable named <code>dog</code> and in that variable, I wanted to put the name of my dog.</p>

<pre><code>var dog;
dog = &quot;Marley&quot;;
</code></pre>

<p>That&#8217;s it. There are a few things to notice here. First, <strong>every line ends with a semi-colon</strong>. JavaScript wants to be your friend and friends try to help each other out. JavaScript tries its best to figure things out for you, but it&#8217;s not very good at it. JavaScript is like that spacey friend of yours that you wouldn&#8217;t trust with your iPod. +skIf you forget the semi-colon, things will probably still work, but it also might not. So, try not to forget the semi-colons. Weird stuff might happen if you do.</p>

<p>It turns out that I could do the two-step process in one step if I really wanted to.</p>

<pre><code>var dog = &quot;Marley&quot;;
</code></pre>

<p>There is no difference between the two. If you forget the keyword <code>var</code>, it will still work, but this is like the semi-colon thing: things will get weird on you. Just trust me. Use semi-colons and use <code>var</code> when defining variables. I wouldn&#8217;t lie to you about this stuff.</p>

<p>Now that I have my dog&#8217;s name stored in the variable <code>dog</code>, I can do all sorts of obnoxious stuff with it.</p>

<pre><code>alert(dog);
confirm(&quot;Do you want to be friends with my dog? His name is &quot; + dog + &quot;.&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>If you look closely, you can see that I can add little bits of text together. This is called <strong>concatenation</strong> and it&#8217;s super useful for plopping your variables into sentences and other fun stuff.</p>

<p>So, that&#8217;s great and wonderful, but the cool part about JavaScript is that it lets us make stuff that&#8217;s interactive. What if we wanted to asked the person visiting our page about their dog? Well, we could use the <code>prompt</code> function to elicit information from the poor soul visiting our page.</p>

<pre><code>var dog;
dog = prompt(&quot;Hey! What's the name of your dog?&quot;);

alert(dog + &quot; is a stupid name for a dog.&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>If we didn&#8217;t store that response in a variable, it would be lost to the ether. But, since we stored it in the variable <code>dog</code>, it&#8217;s available for us to use over and over again.</p>

<pre><code>alert(dog + dog + dog + dog + dog + dog + dog + dog + dog);
</code></pre>

<p>Yea, you get the point. This seems like a good time to mention two things. Those little pieces of text in programming are called <strong>strings</strong>. Anything between quotes is a string and from now on, I&#8217;m going to call them strings. Deal with it. The second thing is that while you can add strings together you can&#8217;t subtract, divide, or multiply them (in some other languages <code>dog * 3</code> would give you <code>MarleyMarleyMarley</code>, but not in JavaScript).</p>

<p>You can use single or double quotes with strings. The basic idea is that you should use whatever it is that won&#8217;t appear in your string. Here&#8217; an example.</p>

<pre><code>// I used double quotes because I needed an apostrophe.
console.log(&quot;I can't believe it.&quot;);

// I used single quotes because I needed double quotes in the string.
console.log('She said, &quot;I will have a corned beef sandwich, please!&quot;');
</code></pre>

<p>You can also store numbers into variables.</p>

<pre><code>var two = 2;
console.log(two + two);
</code></pre>

<p>There are more things we could shove into variables, but we&#8217;ll get to that later.</p>

<p>Alright, try this.</p>

<ol>
<li>Ask the person visit the page what their favorite color is and store their answer in a variable.</li>
<li>Shoot their answer back at them in an alert explaining why their favorite color is pretty much the worse color ever invented.</li>
