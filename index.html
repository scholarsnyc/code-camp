    <h3 id="moving_forward_with_opportunities">Moving Forward and Opportunities</h3>

    <p>I just wanted to let you all know about some awesome opportunities that you might want to think about. Because the class is made up of students with different levels of experience with programming, it&#8217;s hard for me to do one-size-fits-all lessons and more appropriate to let you split off my interests and let me worry about coaching you along and finding the resources you need. If you&#8217;re interested in going down any of these paths. Definitely shoot me an email and I will get everything ready for you.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython">Rice University is offering a free online class on how to program your own games in Python</a>. It&#8217;s a college level course, but it is taught at an introductory level. Plus, I&#8217;ll help you along as well. Python is a pretty awesome language and is definitely worth learning if you are interested in making your own games or hacking a Microsoft Kinect.</p>

    <p><a href="http://appchallenge.tsaweb.org/">Verizon is offering a free Samsung Galaxy Tab to a team of 5 to 10 students who create an innovative app that helps teachers and students learn more about science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.</a> The team would have until January 18 to develop a prototype and compete with other teams around the nation.</p>

    <p>If you are interested in either of these opportunities, let me know.</p>

    <h3>Tuesday, October 9, 2012</h3>
    <p>We're going to code up our first mini-app today. Try to contain your excitement.</p>
    <p>Everything you need to know aboutthe project is locted in <a href="https://github.com/scholarsnyc/madlibs">this code repository</a>.</p>
    <p>In addition, it's probably helpful to remember that there are detailed tutorials below on a bunch of important topics that this assignment touches upon (namely: <code>document.write</code>, <code>prompt</code>, and variables).
    <p>If you are looking for some inspiration, you can check out <a href="https://gist.github.com/3176402">the one I created over the summer</a>.</p>
